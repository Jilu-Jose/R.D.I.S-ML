Project: R.D.I.S:

This Project Focuses on Integrating Machine Learning and Blockchain Technology to create a Refugee Identification System using React.js
and Rust.

Unfortunately, due to lack of some of the packages to integrate the ML model we were only able to make a frontend for the same project and also have added a separete
file consisting of the code to train the model for Facial Recognition.
